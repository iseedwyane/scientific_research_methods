#### Perching Strategy

1. When SCAMP approaches a surface, the **tail** contacts first. (The tail is a means of detecting the wall and as a passive mechanical aid to achieve the appropriate perching maneuver)
2. The tail produces a a large accelerometer signal to trigger perching maneuver.
3. Then the **rotors** are turned on at maximum to pitch the robot into the wall until the feet contact the surface.
4. Then the tail will exert a moment on the quadrotor, which acts to rotate it in the appropriate direction.
5. Once the rotors are near the wall, ground effects act to pull SCAMP tightly against the surface and rotors spool down when the robot is aligned with the wall and vibrations have dissipated.
6. Finally the feet slide down along the wall and engage with the first available foothold.

#### Challenges（本篇攻克的两个challenge，具体解决方法未在此处列出）

1. SCAMP must use a perching strategy that is tolerant of the feet bouncing in and out of contact with the wall during the first milliseconds after impact.
2. Perch outdoors using only onboard sensing and computation. The approach should be able to approach the wall at a variety of speeds, reliably execute the perching maneuver at the correct time, and then determine whether attachment has succeeded or failed.

#### Limitation

This approach is robust within some **angle** and **velocity** constraints.

1. At impact angles θI > 5, the point of impact is above the center of mass , and torque is initially applied in the wrong direction, increasing the chance of failure.
2. The impact velocity must also be large enough to create an acceleration above that experienced during normal flight conditions.1 g is a safe acceleration threshold, corresponding to ≈0.8 m/s. Also, initial velocities above ≈2.8 m/s produce large vibrations and a large initial rebound, which can lead to SCAMP aligning incorrectly.

#### Perching Strategy

The use of **bidirectional motors** and **reverse thrust** is helpful to improve small multirotors’ ability to land on inclined surfaces. Bidirectional motors could potentially allow for faster approaches, while reverse thrust could “dampen” the system’s rebounds after impact and increase the normal contact force and friction. 

实验测试方法：Simply applies maximum reverse thrust on all motors at impact to increase friction. This reduces the bouncing amplitude, helping the quadrotor to quickly come to a stop.

#### Advantages

Reverse thrust alone can increase the landing envelope of a small quadrotor by nearly doubling the maximum inclination on which it can land and by enabling high vertical velocity landings, without involving the addition of heavy and complex landing gears or reduction of payload capacity. (简单说就是只用简单的设备增加可perch的斜度)

#### Limitations

the limitations of bidirectional motors, including thrust reversal asymmetry and delays (我只找到了这句，不知道还有没有)
